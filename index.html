  	<h1>About</h1>
  	<p id="About"> My name is Haileyesus Solomon Belete and I am a second year computer science student at Jacobs University Bremen. I am Ethiopian and was born in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. For high school, I went to Ethio-Parents School in Ethiopia. I like playing football for fun. I love coding and am passionate about computer science.</p>
    
    <h1>Projects</h1>
  	<h3> Robot Arm </h3>
  	<p> I created a Robot arm through MATLAB. I programmed its movement capabilities, joints and structure. It has three movable joints and can move in different axes as can be seen in the MATLAB simulation. It is based on the SCARA robot arm but has more movement capabilities. It can possibly used as an industrial robot arm and in manufacturing.</p>

    <h3>Spaceship</h3>
    <p>I built a spaceship design using MATLAB and programmed a 3D movement of the spaceship.</p>

    <h3>Website</h3>
    <p>I built a simple portfolio website that is this site using HTML and applied styling with CSS. I used the Bootstrap framework for building the website. The website includes information about me and my projects. It also includes my contact information.</p>
